 version 1.45      March 31, 2012
 ------------

 - Added the possibility to disable scanning for annotations or triggers
   when opening a file, depending of the filesize.
   This can be useful when working with big files that take
   a lot of time to read-in annotations, events or triggers.
   (Due to the nature of the EDF-format, the annotations-channel(s)
   needs to be read from the beginning till the end of the file.)
   In the "Settings -> other" dialog you can adjust the filesize
   which above EDFbrowser will not scan the file for annotations.
   (between 100 MB and 10 GB)

 - extended the capabilities of the header-editor. Now it can also fix
   files that have a wrong number of datarecords written in the header
   or when the file does not end at the boundary of a datarecord.
   See the manual for the details.

 version 1.43      Februari 17, 2012
 ------------

   handle filenames and/or directories that contain
   non-ascii characters. From now on, filenames/paths
   will be handled and saved using the local 8-bit
   encoding.

   EDFbrowser will now use all available cpu-cores in your system
   to speedup the drawing of the signals.

 ------------

 - Fixed a bug (introduced with ver. 1.40) that caused a long time to open

   the vertical ruler could disappear.

 version 1.37      August 17, 2011
 ------------

 - Removed the limitation that no more annotations can be saved than the amount of datarecords.
   EDFbrowser could only write one annotation per datarecord. From now on, if there are more

   when saving annotations and when the number in the datarecorddurationfield of the sourcefile
   has more than six digits after the dot.

   and after all signals were removed.

 - Fixed a bug in EDFlib.



 version 1.31      December 8, 2010
 ------------

 - Added a streaming mode. The stream must be a "growing" file.
   This mode can be used when you have an aquisitionprogram running that writes EDF or BDF.
   While the aquisitionprogram writes the data to the file, you can use EDFbrowser to watch
   (follow) the actual data. EDFbrowser will regularly check the actual filesize and show the
   last part of the file i.e. the most actual/recent data.

 ------------

 - Added support for reading the "Status" signal in Biosemi data files.
   This can be switched on/off in the settings menu.

   It converts the Biosemi trigger inputs to annotations which can be
   read and processed by EDFbrowser.

 - Added an EDF-converter for the Bmeye Nexfin / FrameInspector csv-output
   (beat-to-beat data, bloodpressure waveform, analog inputs).

 - Added zoom-in/zoom-out function using Ctrl++ and Ctrl--.

 - Added keyboard shortcuts and accelerators to the menu's.

 - From now on, the timescale will be saved in montages as well.

   opening a file because of an incompatibility while in reality the file was valid.
   This was caused by a localizationproblem which occured only on systems where
   countrysettings are used that uses a comma as a decimal separator.

 - Changed the name of the "Display" menu to "Timescale".

 - Added the entry "3 cm/sec" to the the Timescale menu.

 - From now on EDFbrowser will use the DPI-settings from the underlying windowmanager
   in order to calibrate the screen. If this doesn't work well in your situation,
   you can still calibrate the screen manually in the settingsmenu.

 - Solved a bug that caused malformed waveforms when opening large files (>4 GB)
   and when navigating to the end of the file. This was caused by an integer overflow.

 - Solved a bug in the ASCII to EDF converter (couldn't open templates).

 - Improved the way filters run-in.

 - Added an export function for annotations. This will export
   the annotations to a comma separated textfile.

   clicking on "Select all signals" or "Deselect all signals"
   without a selected file, caused a crash.

 - Fixed a bug in the "Print to EDF" and "Print to BDF" function.
   Filter description in header was wrong (i.e. "LPF:" instead of "LP:").

 - Fixed a bug in the Filter Dialog. When adding a new filter when signals have
   different samplerates, initialisation of the new filter could happen with wrong
   samplerate, causing a wrong frequency of the filter.
